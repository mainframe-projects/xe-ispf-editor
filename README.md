# Debian Package build of XE and GXE for Raspberry pi

Thanks to Sakachin for his editor https://github.com/sakachin2/XE 

All I have done is to create a debian .deb package for easier installation 

PLEASE NOTE THIS DEBIAN PACKAGE IS armhf SPECIFIC

I used the debian build instructions from https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=910717 in order to build this package
